Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard
a bunch about you. See, I was a good
friend of your Daddy's. We were in
that Hanoi pit of hell over five
years together. Hopefully, you'll
never have to experience this
yourself, but when two men are in a
situation like me and your Daddy
were, for as long as we were, you
take on certain responsibilities of
the other. If it had been me who had
not made it, Major Coolidge would be
talkin' right now to my son Jim. But
the way it worked out is I'm talkin'
to you, Butch. I got somethin' for
The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.
This watch I got here was first
purchased by your great-granddaddy.
It was bought during the First World
War in a little general store in
Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought
by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge
the day he set sail for Paris. It
was your great-granddaddy's war watch,
made by the first company to ever
make wrist watches. You see, up until
then, people just carried pocket
watches. Your great-granddaddy wore
that watch every day he was in the
war. Then when he had done his duty,
he went home to your great-
grandmother, took the watch off his
wrist and put it in an ol' coffee
can. And in that can it stayed 'til
your grandfather Dane Coolidge was
called upon by his country to go
overseas and fight the Germans once
again. This time they called it World
War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave
it to your granddad for good luck.
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as
good as his old man's. Your granddad
was a Marine and he was killed with
all the other Marines at the battle
of Wake Island. Your granddad was
facing death and he knew it. None of
those boys had any illusions about
ever leavin' that island alive. So
three days before the Japanese took
the island, your 22-year old
grandfather asked a gunner on an Air
Force transport named Winocki, a man
he had never met before in his life,
to deliver to his infant son, who he
had never seen in the flesh, his
gold watch. Three days later, your
grandfather was dead. But Winocki
kept his word. After the war was
over, he paid a visit to your
grandmother, delivering to your infant
father, his Dad's gold watch. This
watch. This watch was on your Daddy's
wrist when he was shot down over
Hanoi. He was captured and put in a
Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew
if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd
be confiscated. The way your Daddy
looked at it, that watch was your
birthright. And he'd be damned if
and slopeheads were gonna put their
greasy yella hands on his boy's
birthright. So he hid it in the one
place he knew he could hide somethin'.
His ass. Five long years, he wore
this watch up his ass. Then when he
died of dysentery, he gave me the
watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass for two years.
Then, after seven years, I was sent
home to my family. And now, little
man, I give the watch to you.
Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes
into FRAME to accept it.
INT. LOCKER ROOM � NIGHT
The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia:
trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few
zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to
him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory,
he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.
His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a
little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to
be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.
Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB
He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch
hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him
on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH
The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for
As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit.
Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet,

than I've ever seen a victorious
boxer vacate the ring. Do you think
he knew Willis was dead?
My guess would be yes, Richard. I

realization of what he was doing. I
think any man would've left the ring

Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named

She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in
the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:
EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) � NIGHT
A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-
side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage
dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed
in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to
ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.
Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS
to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and
throws it to the ground.

The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet
pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.
INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) � NIGHT
Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through
the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall,
shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave
takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by
the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.
Mia. How you doin'?
Great. I never thanked you for the
In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table �
His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is
on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.
The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table,
hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support.
We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.
Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.
Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.
I'm prepared to scour the earth for

I'll take care of it.

Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.
Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.
He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't
find the roll bar.
Hey, how do I open the window back
I have to do it.
She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch
tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying
Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

You were in that fight? The fight on
the radio � you're the fighter?
As he tosses his other glove out the window.
Whatever gave you that idea?
No c'mon, you're him, I know you're
him, tell me you're him.
You killed the other boxing man.
The radio said he was dead.
He finished wiping himself down.
Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.
He tosses the towel out the window.
Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.
What does it feel like?
What does what feel like?
Killing a man. Beating another man
to death with your bare hands.
Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.
Are you some kinda weirdo?
No, it's a subject I have much
interest in. You are the first person
I ever met who has killed somebody.
So, what was it like to kill a man?
Tell ya what, you give me one of

Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road,
passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not
looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in

He takes a long drag.
He looks at her license.

I'm an American, our names don't

Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."
I don't feel the least little bit

We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.
What'd I tell ya, soon as the word
got out a fix was in, the odds would
be outta control. Hey, if he was a
better fighter he's be alive. If he
never laced up his gloves in the
first place, which he never shoulda
done, he'd be alive. Enough about
the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's
talk about the rich and prosperous

be on Tennessee time.
Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to
take him wherever he wants to go.

EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) � NIGHT
Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain
has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out,
now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic
jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.
Handing her the money.
Merci beaucoup. And here's a little
something for the effort.
Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.
Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds
it out of reach.
Now if anybody should ask you about
who your fare was tonight, what're
you gonna tell 'em?
The truth. Three well-dressed,
He gives her the bill.
He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away.
INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) � NIGHT
Butch enters and turns on the light.
Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to
us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.
Keep the light off.
Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.
Is that better, sugar pop?
Oui. Hard day at the office?
Pretty hard. I got into a fight.
Poor baby. Can we make spoons?
Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.
When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in

I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna

I didn't realize there was a
difference between a tummy and a pot
The difference is huge.
You want me to have a pot?
No. Pot bellies make a man look either
oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a
woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The
rest of you is normal. Normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal
ass, but with a big, perfectly round
pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a
tee-shirt two sizes too small to

Really?! He won't be fighting no
So it all worked out in the finish?
We ain't at the finish, baby.
Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?
Butch nods his head: "yes."
If they find us, they'll kill us,
Butch nods his head: "yes."
But they won't find us, will they?
Butch nods his head: "no."
Do you still want me to go with you?
Butch nods his head: "yes."
I don't want to be a burden or a
Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her
Fabienne, I want you to be with me.
Fabienne lies her head back.
Butch continues to massage her crotch.
Do you love me?
Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?
Butch kisses her on the mouth.
Will you kiss it?
She nods her head: "yes."
Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral
pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.
Butch my love, the adventure begins.
Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in
the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We
see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow
She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower
washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the
smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom.
Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his

Giving me oral pleasure?
No retard, from the fight.

She hands him a towel.
Where are we going to go?
I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.
We're gonna get a lot of money from
this. But it ain't gonna be so much,
we can live like hogs in the fat
house forever. I was thinking we
could go somewhere in the South
Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll
carry us a long way down there.
So if we wanted, we could live in

Where's the shoe store?

Excellent pronunciation. You'll be

Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes
Butch keeps on from the other room.
What time is it?
What time is it?
Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.
Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or
two, then she remember something.
She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only
to find him sound asleep in bed.
She looks at him for a moment.
She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the
WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.
MOTEL ROOM � MORNING
SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still
Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the
bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still
wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.
ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking
on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".
Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing

Merde! You startled me. Did you have

What are you watching?
A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the
Are you watchin' it?
Fabienne enters the room.
In a way. Why? Would you like for me
to switch it off?
She reaches over and turns off the TV.
It's a little too early in the morning
for explosions and war.
What was it about?
How should I know, you were the one
No, imbecile, what was your dream
Oh, I... don't remember. It's really
rare I remember a dream.
You just woke up from it.
Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I
Well, let's look at the grumpy man
in the morning. I didn't say you
were lying, it's just odd you don't
remember your dreams. I always
remember mine. Did you know you talk
I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk
You did last night.
What did I say?
Laying on top of him.
I don't know. I couldn't understand
Why don't you get up and we'll get
some breakfast at that breakfast
place with the pancakes.
One more kiss and I'll get up.
Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.
Then get up, lazy bones.
Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of
the suitcase that Fabienne brought.
What time is it?
Almost nine in the morning. What
time does our train arrive?
I'm gonna order a big plate of
blueberry pancakes with maple syrup,
eggs over easy, and five sausages.
Anything to drink with that?
Butch is finished dressing.
Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a
tall glass or orange juice and a
black cup of coffee. After that, I'm
going to have a slice of pie.
As he goes through the suitcase.
Any time of the day is a good time
for pie. Blueberry pie to go with
the pancakes. And on top, a thin
slice of melted cheese �
� where's my watch?
No, it's not. It's not here.
By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.
Yes I've fuckin' looked!!
He's now throwing clothes.
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!
Are you sure you got it?
Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.
Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer
� on the little kangaroo.
Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.
Well it's not here!
(on the verge of tears)
Well it should be!
Oh it most definitely should be here,
but it's not. So where is it?
Fabienne is crying and scared.
Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more
Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin'
watch. You know what my father went
through to git me that watch?... I
don't wanna get into it right now...
but he went through a lot. Now all
this other shit, you coulda set on
fire, but I specifically reminded
you not to forget my father's watch.
Now think, did you get it?
You believe so? You either did, or
you didn't, now which one is it?
Butch freaks out, he punches the air.
Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the
motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.
Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.
Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.
No! It's not your fault.
You left it at the apartment.
He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.
He touches her hand, she flinches.
If you did leave it at the apartment,
it's not your fault. I had you bring
a bunch of stuff. I reminded you
about it, but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me. If
all I gave a fuck about was my watch,
I should've told you. You ain't a
He kisses her hand. Then rises.
Fabienne is still sniffling.
Butch goes to the closet.
Butch puts on his high school jacket.
Don't be. It just means I won't be
able to eat breakfast with you.
Why does it mean that?
Because I'm going back to my apartment
to get my watch.
Won't the gangsters be looking for
That's what I'm gonna find out. If
they are, and I don't think I can
handle it, I'll split.
Rising from the floor.
I was so dreadful. I saw your watch,
I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.
Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.
Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing
you could ever do would make me
permanently angry at you.
I love you, remember?
(he digs some money
out of his wallet)
Now here's some money, order those
pancakes and have a great breakfast.
I'll be back before you can say,
Well maybe not that fast, but fast.
He kisses her once more and heads for the door.
I'm gonna take your Honda.
And with that, he's out the door.
Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

fists as he drives down the street.
Of all the fuckin' things she coulda

I specifically reminded her not to

The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is
little engine will take it.
A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the
arrow pointing at one hour.
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER � DAY
Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a
couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before
he goes boppin' through the front door.
EXT. ALLEY � DAY
Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street,
then he discreetly glances out.
EXT. STREET � BUTCH'S APARTMENT � DAY
Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of
cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of
place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.
Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of
Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.
Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He
crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.
Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a
combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign
sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a
graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.
EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD � DAY
Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment
building. Once again, everything appears normal � the laundry
room, the pool, his apartment door � nothing appears
Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12.
He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.
Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening
INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT � DAY
His apartment hasn't been touched.
He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick
look around. Obviously, no one is there.
Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the
He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.
With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he
goes to the bedroom.
His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment � neat, clean
and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a
few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue
of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of
Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.
Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On
the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.
He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He
opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting
down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and
puts them in the toaster.
Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.
What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun
with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.
He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines
Then... a toilet FLUSHES.
Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to
the kitchen. There is someone behind it.
Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not
knowing what to do.
The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the
bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book
"MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.
Vincent and Butch lock eyes.
Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's
Neither man opens his mouth.
Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.
That's all the situation needed.
Butch's finger HITS the trigger.
MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.
Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets
SIMULTANEOUSLY � LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him
through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door
at the end of the bathroom.
By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent

goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once
