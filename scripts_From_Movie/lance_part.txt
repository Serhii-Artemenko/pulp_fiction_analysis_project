good stuff. This is Bava, different,
but equally good. And this is Choco
from the Hartz Mountains of Germany.
Now the first two are the same, forty-
five an ounce � those are friend
prices � but this one...
(pointing to the Choco)
...this one's a little more expensive.
It's fifty-five. But when you shoot
it, you'll know where that extra
money went. Nothing wrong with the
first two. It's real, real, real,
good shit. But this one's a fuckin'
Remember, I just got back from
Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood?
No. You're in my house. White people
who know the difference between good
shit and bad shit, this is the house
they come to. My shit, I'll take the
Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit
any ol' day of the fuckin' week.
That's a bold statement.
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is
a seller's market. Coke is fuckin'
dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole
seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin,
they're as hot as hell.
Vincent takes out a roll of money that would choke a horse
Give me three hundred worth of the
madman. If it's as good as you say,
I'll be back for a thousand.
I just hope I still have it. Whaddya
think of Trudi? She ain't got a
boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get
Which one's Trudi? The one with all
the shit in her face?
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.
Vincent and Lance giggle at the "faux pas."
I'm on my way somewhere. I got a
dinner engagement. Rain check?
Vincent takes out his case of the works (utensils for shooting
You don't mind if I shoot up here?
Me casa, su casa.
Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two
continue to talk, Vince shoots up.
Still got your Malibu?
You know what some fucker did to it
Oh man, that's fucked up.
Tell me about it. I had the goddamn
thing in storage three years. It's
out five fuckin' days � five days,

trial, no jury, straight to execution.
As he cooks his heroin...
I just wish I caught 'em doin' it,
ya know? Oh man, I'd give anything
to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been
worth his doin' it, if I coulda just
caught 'em, you know what I mean?

EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S � NIGHT
In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over
L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're
all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book,
Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer,
saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the
Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and
over prices that pay for all this bullshit.
But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's
Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of
Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with
a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a
red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath
the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that
is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."
What the fuck is this place?
This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis
man should love it.
Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.
You can get a steak here, daddy-o.
Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on
the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.
INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S � NIGHT
Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint
English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over
("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF
THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that
the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s
In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign
on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers
(actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or
The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead,
B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The
WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons:
MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and
LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing
Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red
'59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting
a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing
Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?
I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.
How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp,
or bloody as hell?
Bloody as hell. And to drink, a
How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?
I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger �
bloody � and a five-dollar shake.
How d'ya want that shake, Martin and
Lewis, or Amos and Andy?
Did you just order a five-dollar
A shake? Milk and ice cream?
It costs five dollars?
You don't put bourbon in it or
Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are
dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers,
and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing,
The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her
customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a
It's like a wax museum with a pulse
Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling
After a second of watching him �
What are you doing?
Oh. Well in that case, will you roll
As he finishes licking it �
You can have this one, cowgirl.
He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to
her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's
hand. He lights it.
Think nothing of it.
He begins rolling one for himself.
As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner,
making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a
square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS
the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out
a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.
Back to Mia and Vincent.
Marsellus said you just got back
Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.
That was my fifteen minutes.
It was show about a team of female
secret agents called "Fox Force Five."
"Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a
bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in
we're a force to be reckoned with.
Five, as in there's one... two ...
three... four... five of us. There
was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal
from that show "Baton Rouge," she
was the leader. A Japanese one, a
black one, a French one and a brunette
one, me. We all had special skills.
Sommerset had a photographic memory,
the Japanese fox was a kung fu master,
the black girl was a demolition
expert, the French fox' specialty
What was your specialty?
Knives. The character I played, Raven
McCoy, her background was she was
raised by circus performers. So she
grew up doing a knife act. According
to the show, she was the deadliest
woman in the world with a knife. But
because she grew up in a circus, she
was also something of an acrobat.
She could do illusions, she was a
trapeze artist � when you're keeping
the world safe from evil, you never
know when being a trapeze artist's
gonna come in handy. And she knew a
zillion old jokes her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her. If
we woulda got picked up, they woulda
worked in a gimmick where every
episode I woulda told and ol joke.
Do you remember any of the jokes?
Well I only got the chance to say
one, 'cause we only did one show.
No. It's really corny.
C'mon, don't be that way.
No. You won't like it and I'll be
You told it in front of fifty million
people and you can't tell it to me?
I promise I won't laugh.
That's what I'm afraid of.
That's not what I meant and you know
You're quite the silver tongue devil,
I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.
That's not what you said Vince. Well
now I'm definitely not gonna tell
ya, 'cause it's been built up too
Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around
the straw of her shake.
Can I have a sip of that? I'd like
to know what a five-dollar shake
She slides the shake over to him.
You can use my straw, I don't have
Yeah, but maybe I do.
Kooties I can handle.
He takes a sip.
Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin'
I don't know if it's worth five
dollars, but it's pretty fuckin'
He slides the shake back.
Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.
Don't you hate that?
Uncomfortable silences. Why do we
feel it's necessary to yak about
bullshit in order to be comfortable?
That's when you know you found
somebody special. When you can just
shit the fuck up for a minute, and
I don't think we're there yet. But
don't feel bad, we just met each
Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to

We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy

capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS �
... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I
don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it
must be her night off.
Did ya think of something to say?
Actually, there's something I've
wanted to ask you about, but you
seem like a nice person, and I didn't
want to offend you.
Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like
you chit-chat. This sounds like you
actually have something to say.
Only if you promise not to get
You can't promise something like
that. I have no idea what you're
gonna ask. You could ask me what
you're gonna ask me, and my natural
response could be to be offended.
Then, through no fault of my own, I
woulda broken my promise.
Then let's just forget it.
That is an impossibility. Trying to
forget anything as intriguing as
this would be an exercise in futility.
Is that a fact?
Mia nods her head: "Yes."
Besides, it's more exciting when you
What do you think about what happened
He fell out of a window.
That's one way to say it. Another
way is, he was thrown out. Another
was is, he was thrown out by
Marsellus. And even another way is,
he was thrown out of a window by
Marsellus because of you.
Is that a fact?
No it's not, it's just what I heard.
Who told you this?
Mia and Vincent smile.
They talk a lot, don't they?
Well don't by shy Vincent, what
exactly did they say?
Vincent is slow to answer.
Let me help you Bashful, did it
No. They just said Rocky Horror gave
you a foot massage.
No and, that's it.
You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror
out of a four-story window because
he massaged my feet?
And you believed that?
At the time I was told, it seemed
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a
four story window for giving me a
foot massage seemed reasonable?
No, it seemed excessive. But that
doesn't mean it didn't happen. I
heard Marsellus is very protective
A husband being protective of his
wife is one thing. A husband almost
killing another man for touching his
wife's feet is something else.
But did it happen?
The only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand, when he shook
it. I met Anwan once � at my wedding
� then never again. The truth is,
nobody knows why Marsellus tossed
Tony Rocky Horror out of that window
except Marsellus and Tony Rocky
Horror. But when you scamps get
together, you're worse than a sewing

Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL".
They make hand movements as they dance.
INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME � NIGHT
The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the
previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.
The two just stand face to face looking at each other.
Was than an uncomfortable silence?
I don't know what that was.
Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his
overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.
I'm gonna take a piss.
That was a little bit more information
than I needed to know, but go right
Vincent shuffles off to the john.
Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs
and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high
energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She
dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's
overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It
Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch.
Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco
on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks
the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a
little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so
anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out
his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg,
trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you
know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly
brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up,
then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.
The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she
takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in
the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something
else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder
inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance.
Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her
(like you would say
Disco! Vince, you little cola nut,
you've been holding out on me.
INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) � NIGHT
Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to
himself in the mirror.
One drink and leave. Don't be rude,
but drink your drink quickly, say
goodbye, walk out the door, get in
your car, and go down the road.
Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines
on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred
dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the
Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels
like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong.
Then... the rush hits...
Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his
dialogue with the mirror.

whether or not you can maintain
loyalty. Because when people are
loyal to each other, that's very
Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but
it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from
her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her
stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.
So you're gonna go out there, drink
your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had
a very lovely evening," go home, and
jack off. And that's all you're
Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's
ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of
that door. So he goes through it.
We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to
the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like
a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are
down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the
tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her
face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open.
Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body.
Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck
to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.
Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.
Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?
But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles,
but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.
Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.
I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer
me honey, what did you take?
Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.
Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the
He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent
makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.
Okay honey, we're getting you on
He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.
We're on our feet now, and now we're
gonna talk out to the car. Here we
go, watch us walk.
We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant
drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.
He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-
out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT,
CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand
is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of
him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n
Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in

assholes never to call this late!
I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna

At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu
coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his
curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH
in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn

standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of

While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta

What do you need a medical book for?
To tell me how to do it. I've never
given an adrenaline shot before.

Lance continues his frenzied search.

What's he lookin' for?
I dunno, some medical book.
Jody calls to LANCE.
What are you lookin' for?
My black medical book!
As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit,
Jody appears in the doorway.
Whata're you looking for?
My black fuckin' medical book. It's
like a text book they give to nurses.
I never saw a medical book.
Trust me, I have one.
Well if it's that important, why
didn't you keep it with the shot?
Lance spins toward her.
I don't know! Stop bothering me!
