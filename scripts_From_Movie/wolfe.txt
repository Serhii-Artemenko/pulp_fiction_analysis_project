TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:
"NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER"
EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET � MORNING
A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home,
in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a
dime in front of Jimmie's house.
A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.
INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE � MORNING
Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the
tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at
You're Jimmie, right? This is your
(stick his hand out)
I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.
Good, 'cause we got one.
So I heard. May I come in?
In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.
You must be Jules, which would make
you Vincent. Let's get down to brass
tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed
correctly, the clock is ticking, is
(refers to his pad)
...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is
I was led to believe if she comes
home and finds us here, she wouldn't
appreciate it none too much.
She won't at that.
That gives us forty minutes to get
the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you
do what I say when I say it, should
by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a
car, minus a head, in a garage. Take
INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE � MORNING
The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He
studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside,
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee in there. Would
you make me a cup?
Sure, how do you take it?
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.
About the car, is there anything I
need to know? Does it stall, does it
make a lot of noise, does it smoke,
is there gas in it, anything?
Aside from how it looks, the car's
Positive? Don't get me out on the
road and I find out the brake lights
Hey man, as far as I know, the
Good enough, let's go back to the
INT. KITCHEN � MORNING
Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.
He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the
three men the plan of action.
Okay first thing, you two.
Take the body, stick it in the trunk.
Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty
domesticated house. That would lead
me to believe that in the garage or
under the sink, you got a bunch of
cleansers and cleaners and shit like
that, am I correct?
Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.
Good. What I need you two fellas to
do is take those cleaning products
and clean the inside of the car. And
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You
need to go in the backseat, scoop up
all those little pieces of brain and
skull. Get it out of there. Wipe
down the upholstery � now when it
comes to upholstery, it don't need
to be spic and span, you don't need
to eat off it. Give it a good once
over. What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts. The pools
of blood that have collected, you
gotta soak that shit up. But the
windows are a different story. Them
you really clean. Get the Windex, do
a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to
raid your linen closet. I need
blankets, I need comforters, I need
quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker
the better, the darker the better.
No whites, can't use 'em. We need to
camouflage the interior of the car.
We're gonna line the front seat and
the backseat and the floor boards
with quilts and blankets. If a cop
stops us and starts stickin' his big
snout in the car, the subterfuge
won't last. But at a glance, the car
will appear to be normal. Jimmie �
lead the way, boys � get to work.
The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving
Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.
A "please" would be nice.
The Wolf stops and turns around.
I said a "please" would be nice.
The Wolf takes a step toward him.
Set is straight, Buster. I'm not
here to say "please."I'm here to
tell you want to do. And if self-
preservation is an instinct you
possess, you better fuckin' do it
and do it quick. I'm here to help.
If my help's not appreciated, lotsa
It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your
help is definitely appreciated.
I don't mean any disrespect. I just
don't like people barkin' orders at
If I'm curt with you, it's because
time is a factor. I think fast, I
talk fast, and I need you guys to
act fast if you want to get out of
this. So pretty please, with sugar
on top, clean the fuckin' car.
INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM � MORNING
Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he
The Wolf is on the phone.
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
Nothin', except for the mess inside.
Nobody who'll be missed.
You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.
(he looks at Jimmie)
How we comin', Jimmie?
Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand
� Winston, Jimmie � please, Winston.
You gotta understand something,
Winston. I want to help you guys out
and all, but that's my best linen.
It was a wedding present from my
Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and
they ain't with us anymore �
� let me ask you a question, if you
Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And
I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and
Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they
would've furnished you with a whole
bedroom set, which your Uncle
Marsellus is more than happy to do.
(takes out a roll of
I like oak myself, that's what's in
my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie,
you an oak man?
INT. GARAGE � MORNING
Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up.
Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is
in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs
Both are twice as bloody as they were before.
I will never forgive your ass for
this shit. This is some fucked-up
Did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he's wrong,
he's immediately forgiven for all
Man, get outta my face with that
shit! The motherfucker who said that
never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces
of skull with his fingers on account
of your dumb ass.
I got a threshold, Jules. I got a
threshold for the abuse I'll take.
And you're crossin' it. I'm a race
car and you got me in the red. Redline
7000, that's where you are. Just
know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be
drivin' a race car when it's in the
red. It could blow.
You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a
Every time my fingers touch brain
I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS
OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker
usta talk about. In fact, what the
fuck am I doin' in the back? You're
the motherfucker should be on brain
detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin'
windows and you're pickin' up this
INT. CHEVY NOVA � MORNING
The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with
bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a
portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript
The Wolf circles the car examining it.
Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a
bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a
good job they've done.
Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out
I can't believe that's the same car.
Well, let's not start suckin' each
other's dicks quite yet. Phase one
is complete, clean the car, which
moves us right along to phase two,
EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD � MORNING
Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits,
covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic
Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one
of those guns nozzles attached.
To your bare ass.
As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.
Quickly gentlemen, we got about
fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
half comes pulling into the driveway.
This morning air is some chilly shit.
Are you sure this is absolutely
You know what you two look like?
Like a couple of guys who just blew
off somebody's head. Yes, strippin'
off those bloody rags is absolutely
necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's
Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid
like puttin' that out in front of
your house for Elmo the garbage man
Don't worry, we're takin' it with
us. Jim, the soap.
He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.
Okay gentlemen, you're both been to
County before, I'm sure. Here it
He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.
Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!
Better you than me, gentlemen.
The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.
Don't be afraid of the soap, spread
The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.
Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously
You're dry enough, give 'em their
JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They
look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses
Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've
planned this better. You guys look
like... what do they look like,
Dorks. They look like a couple of
The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,
I guess you just gotta know how to
Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert
on wearin' dorky shit that your is.
C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and
jokin' our way into prison. Don't
INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE � MORNING
The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin.
The Wolf SLAMS is closed.
Gentlemen, let's get our rules of
the road straight. We're going to a
place called Monster Joe's Truck and
Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter
Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.
The place is North Hollywood, so a
few twist and turns aside, we'll be
goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll
drive the tainted car. Jules, you
ride with me. Vincent, you follow
in my Porsche. Now if we cross the
path of any John Q. Laws, nobody
does a fuckin' thing 'til I do
What did I say?
Don't do shit unless �
Unless you do it first.
Spoken like a true prodigy.
How 'bout you, Lash Larue? Can you
keep your spurs from jingling and
I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went
off, I dunno how.
(he throws Vince his
I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep
up. If I get my car back any different
than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna
be disposing of two bodies.
EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW � MORNING
Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.
Like it never happened.
Jules and Vincent bump fists.
Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all
this will be hers.
Hi. You know, if they ever do "I
SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys,
I'd be great. What's with the
outfits. You guys going to a
Winston laughs, the boys groan.
I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast.
Maybe I can drop you two off. Where
Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a
It's your future: I see... a cab
Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
I'll see you two around, and stay
outta trouble, you crazy kids.
Winston turns to leave.
I was a pleasure watchin' you work.
He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.
You hear that, young lady? Respect.
You could lean a lot from those two
fine specimens. Respect for one's
Just because you are a character
doesn't mean you have character.
Oh you're so funny, oh you're so
The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.
The two men left alone look at each other.
Wanna share a cab?
You know I could go for some
breakfast. Want to have breakfast
INT. COFFEE SHOP � MORNING
Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a
big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto.
Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a
muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a
refill for both men,
Naw, I don't eat pork.
I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig
They're filthy animals. I don't eat
Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste
A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin
pie. I'll never know 'cause even if
it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy
motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in
shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't
wanna eat nothin' that ain't got
enough sense to disregard its own
How about dogs? Dogs eat their own
I don't eat dog either.
Yes, but do you consider a dog to be
I wouldn't go so far as to call a
dog filthy, but they're definitely
dirty. But a dog's got personality.
And personality goes a long way.
So by that rationale, if a pig had a
better personality, he's cease to be
We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one
motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd
have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.
The two men laugh.
Good for you. Lighten up a little.
You been sittin' there all quiet.
I just been sittin' here thinkin'.
The miracle we witnessed.
The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed
Do you know that a miracle is?
An act of God.
What's an act of God?
I guess it's when God makes the
impossible possible. And I'm sorry
Jules, but I don't think what happened
Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't
matter. You're judging this thing
the wrong way. It's not about what.
It could be God stopped the bullets,
he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found
my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge
shit like this based on merit. Whether
or not what we experienced was an
insignificant. What is significant
is I felt God's touch, God got
That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I
don't know why. But I can't go back
So you're serious, you're really
The life, most definitely.
Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In
the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.
We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene
of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.
So if you're quitting the life,
That's what I've been sitting here
contemplating. First, I'm gonna
deliver this case to Marsellus. Then,
basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.
What do you mean, walk the earth?
You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU."
Just walk from town to town, meet
people, get in adventures.
How long do you intend to walk the
Until God puts me where he want me
What if he never does?
If it takes forever, I'll wait
So you decided to be a bum?
I'll just be Jules, Vincent � no
No Jules, you're gonna be like those
pieces of shit out there who beg for
change. They walk around like a bunch
of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in
garbage bins, they eat what I throw
away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got
a word for 'em, they're called bums.
And without a job, residence, or
legal tender, that's what you're
gonna be � a fuckin' bum!
Look my friend, this is just where
me and you differ �
� what happened was peculiar � no
doubt about it � but it wasn't water
All shapes and sizes, Vince.
Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!
If you find my answers frightening,
Vincent, you should cease askin'
I gotta take a shit. To be continued.
Vincent exits for the restroom.
Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin
and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.
Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the
table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it
Customers stay seated, waitresses on
Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die,
do it or fucking die!
Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While
Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them
You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out
Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.
On the floor or I'll cook you ass,
They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.
I'm the manager here, there's no
problem, no problem at all �
Pumpkin heads his way.
You're gonna give me a problem?
He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the
What? You said you're gonna give me
No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you
I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks
like the hero type to me!
Don't take any chances. Execute him!
The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his
hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.
Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm
just a coffee shop manager. Take
Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll
Everybody just be calm and cooperate
with them and this will be all over
Well done, now git your fuckin' ass
INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM � MORNING
Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,
reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.
INT. COFFEE SHOP � MORNING
Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from
the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter
with a trash bag in his hand.
Okay people, I'm going to go 'round
and collect your wallets. Don't talk,
just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?
Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his
.45 ready to spit under the table.
Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,
briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more
respectful, him manner more on guard.
Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,
Pumpkin points to the briefcase.
My boss' dirty laundry.
You boss makes you do his laundry?
When he wants it clean.
Sounds like a shit job.
Funny, I've been thinkin' the same
Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.
'Fraid I can't do that.
Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the
gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the
I didn't hear you.
This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard
it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.
Looks like we got a vigilante in our
Shoot 'em in the face!
I don't mean to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time I've
had gun pointed at me.
You don't open up that case, it's
gonna be the last.
Quit causing problems, you'll get us
all killed! Give 'em what you got
and get 'em out of here.
Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat
man, this ain't any of your goddamn
I'm countin' to three, and if your
hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna
unload right in your fuckin' face.
Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.
It's all yours, Ringo.
Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to
Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case.
Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across
the room, can't see shit.
What is it? What is it?
Is that what I think it is?
Jules nods his head: "yes."
Jules nods his head: "yes."
Goddammit, what is it?
Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering
the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to
pick up the case.
Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of
Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand
comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45
hand under Pumpkin's chin.
Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.
Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow
your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya!
I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're
gonna fuckin' die bad!
Tell that bitch to be cool! Say,
bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!
Tell her it's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna be okay.
Tell her to chill.
Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only
So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna
do anything stupid, are we?
Don't you hurt him.
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're
gonna be like three Fonzies. And
C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?
Correct-amundo! And that's what we're
gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three
and I want you to let go your gun
and lay your palms flat on the table.
But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?
Pumpkin looks at him.
Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.
Yolanda can't stand it anymore.
Okay, now let him go!
Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be
cool. When you yell at me, it makes
me nervous. When I get nervous, I
get scared. And when motherfuckers
get scared, that's when motherfuckers
Just know: you hurt him, you die.
That seems to be the situation. Now
I don't want that and you don't want
that and Ringo here don't want that.
So let's see what we can do.
Now this is the situation. Normally
both of your asses would be dead as
fuckin' fried chicken. But you
happened to pull this shit while I'm
in a transitional period. I don't
wanna kill ya, I want to help ya.
But I'm afraid I can't give you the
case. It don't belong to me. Besides,
I went through too much shit this
morning on account of this case to
just hand it over to your ass.
What the fuck's goin' on here?
Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.
Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at
It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't
do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's
cool baby, nothin's changed. We're
Tell her we're still cool.
It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still
What the hell's goin' on, Jules?
Nothin' I can't handle. I want you
to just hang back and don't do shit
unless it's absolutely necessary.
Yolanda, how we doin, baby?
I gotta go pee! I want to go home.
Just hang in there, baby, you're
doing' great, Ringo's proud of you
and so am I. It's almost over.
Now I want you to go in that bag and
Which one is it?
It's the one that says Bad
Pumpkin looks in the bag and � sure enough � there's a wallet
with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.
That's my bad motherfucker. Now open
it up and take out the cash. How
About fifteen hundred dollars.
Put it in your pocket, it's yours.
Now with the rest of them wallets
and the register, that makes this a
pretty successful little score.
Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen
hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing,
now hang back and shut the fuck up.
Besides, I ain't givin' it to him.
I'm buyin' somethin' for my money.
Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't hafta kill your ass. You
There's a passage I got memorized.
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of the darkness. For he
is truly his brother's keeper and
the finder of lost children. And I
will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know I am the
Lord when I lay my vengeance upon
you." I been sayin' that shit for
years. And if you ever heard it, it
meant your ass. I never really
questioned what it meant. I thought
it was just a coldblooded thing to
say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped
a cap in his ass. But I saw some
shit this mornin' made me think twice.
Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're
the evil man. And I'm the righteous
man. And Mr. .45 here, he's the
shepherd protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness. Or is
could by you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd and it's the
world that's evil and selfish. I'd
like that. But that shit ain't the
truth. The truth is you're the weak.
And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But
I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to

Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to
Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the
Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time,
takes a sip of coffee.
He pushes it aside.
Vincent appears next to Jules.
I think we oughta leave now.
That's probably a good idea.
Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the
Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the
Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes
� wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts,
swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics � walk out of
the coffee shop together without saying a word.
